# Supseasonal - React

Built in a team of two (@danielmarcgardner and @SashaBerkowitz). This  project is an intro into React and Redux and is a front end application built for the [Supseasonal API](http://supseasonal.herokuapp.com/) built by two other G42 students for their Q2 project. It allows users to see seasonal ingredients that are available by month or when the ingredients are available seasonally. Users can also search for recipes that use seasonal ingredients.
